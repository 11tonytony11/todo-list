# Todo list
A simple todo list web app created using React, Node.js &amp; MongoDB.

## Users
Since it is a small app created mainly for learning React, Node.js and MongoDB, I've created two default users but didn't creat Register form.

## Tasks
Each tasks can be marked as Done or not Done. Tasks will be marked by Green/Red border.

## Statistics
I have also added a little pie chart using Chart.js to show basic statistics to the user.
